        When Sawyer opened her eyes, she didn’t see anyone, she stood up and looked around but couldn’t 
        find anyone. She sat down on the chair and stared at the ceiling, she was lost in her thought that 
        she didn’t even notice when the doctor came in. The doctor tapped her and she flinched. <br>

“It’s me” The Doctor said and she glanced at him. <br>

She sat down on the chair back then they Doctor asked if she is okay, she nodded. <br>

“Can I go back to the hostel today, Doctor” She asked, gazing at him. <br>

“Yes, that’s what I am here to tell you” The Doctor said. <br>

She nodded slowly and the doctor prescribed her some drugs. Some hours later, she was done packing her stuff
 when Brian and Juan entered, she hissed immediately she saw them. <br>

Brian and Juan exchanged glanced and called her then they told her they are here to take to the hostel but 
she refuse to go with them. <br>

“Rhett is not with us” Said Brian as he moved closer to her. <br>

“Don’t move closer to me… I refuse to allow you guys to take me to the hostel” She said and picked up her. <br>

She dialed Mimi’s number and put the phone at speaking when Mimi picked up, she told Mimi to come to the 
hospital. <br>

“I am busy, right now” Mimi said and hung up. <br>

Juan smiled and touched her, she turned his hand and told him to stay away from her then she glared at him. 
She called Piper but her number is not reachable. <br>

“I have no choice but to go with them” She thought. <br>

“Are you ready to leave” Brian asked and she glanced at them. <br>

She nodded slowly. <br>

Juan smiled and they left the hospital when they got outside, they entered the car. The drive drove off, 
none of them spoke to themselves till they got to the college. <br>

Two hours later, they got to the car and the driver parked the car then they got down. Sawyer bid them
 goodbye and went inside the hostel when she got inside, she met Mimi laying on the bed sleeping. 
 She frowned and woke her up. <br>

“Leave me alone” Mimi said as she groaned. <br>

She opened her, immediately she saw Sawyer, she sat up and blink her eyes then she asked her when she came in. <br>

“I came in when you were busy sleeping… you girl really offended me, you left me at the hospital alone” Sawyer said, <br> angrily.

“It was Rhett that said we shouldn’t bother that he is gonna bring you the hostel” Mimi said and she frowned. <br>

“What?? I don’t love him, why is he forcing himself on me… he is only wasting his time” Sawyer said as she undressed her
 clothes. <br>

When she was done undressing her clothes, she wrapped a towel on her body. She was about to enter the toilet
 when Mimi called, she turned to her with a frown. Mimi told her not to get angry and apologised to her. <br>

“Okay” She said with a nod. <br>

She enters the toilet. <br>

BRJ’S MANSION*** <br>

The next day, when Rhett and his friends were done dressing they left the Mansion. Some hours later, they 
got to College and headed straight to class. They were busy chatting  so they didn’t notice that Sawyer 
and her friends were coming, then they bumped into each other. Sawyer books dropped on the floor. <br>

“Oh, I am sorry” 

Saying this Rhett bent down and picked the books and the papers which had been scattered all over the floor.
 He put the papers at the middle of the books back and gave it to her then he apologised to her. Sawyer 
 collected the book, she glared at him and walked away without saying anything. <br>

“Sorry, don’t mind her… she is not in a good mood” Mimi said and Piper nodded. <br>

She also  apologized to him. <br>

“Okay” Rhett nodded and entered the class with them. <br>

 When they got into the class, they met Sawyer arranging the papers, Rhett stared at her for a while and went 
 to his seat. Karin glanced at the both of them and smirked then she glared at Sawyer. <br>

She walked towards where Sawyer’s sitting, she glared at her  and folded her hands beneath her breast,
 Piper glanced at her then she asked her what she wanted. <br>

“Hey, keep your fucking my shut… I am not here because of you but her” Karin said, pointing at Sawyer. <br>

“Me… okay, what do you want?” Sawyer asked. <br>

“I warned you last time to stay away from Rhett but I think you don’t wanna listen… this is your last chance, 
if I see you with Rhett, you are dead”  <br>

By saying that she walked away swaying her butt, Sawyer frowned and glanced at Rhett. She stood up and walked 
towards him when she got to where Rhett was sitting, she dragged him up. The students gasped and started
 murmuring. <br>

“Didn’t I told you to stay away from me? That b**h came to me because of you… Rhett or whatever your name is 
stay away from me, I hate your behavior” Sawyer yelled and was about to leave when he held her. <br>

He dragged her to himself and hugged her tightly. <br>

“Leave me” Sawyer said, trying to free herself from his grip. <br>

Rhett disengaged from the hug and she landed a slap on his face, the students were shocked. She went to her 
sit and packed her stuff, she glared at Karin then she left the class. Mimi immediately followed her while
 Piper went to meet Rhett. <br>

“I am…” <br>

Her sentence was interrupted. <br>

“I know you are here to apologise on behalf… it’s okay” Rhett said and left the class. <br>

Piper sighed out loud and frowned. <br>

BRJ’S ROOM*** <br>

When Rhett got to the Mansion, he didn’t  care to lock the door. He sat down on the couch, his mind drifting 
to what Sawyer did to him, he felt so sad. He took a cigarette and lightened, then he started smoking 
instantly, he rubbed his hair, he took a beer and pour himself. He started drinking. <br>

An hour later, he was still drinking and smoking when he heard a knock on  the door and Karin entered smiling.
 She rushed to him and hugged him tightly. Rhett stood up to push her away but he stumbled. <br>

“Gently, Babe” Karin said. <br>

“G..et…get out” He shouted but she didn’t move an inch. <br>

“This is my only chance so I can’t loose it” Karin said and began to unhook his trousers. <br>

She bit her lips seductively, her b**bs visible through the top she was putting on, she kissed him and was
 about to s**k his d**k when Juan and Brian entered. <br>

“What?” <br>

Brian ran towards her and pushed her away, he faced her frowning his face. <br>

“Are you crazy? What do you think you are doing?” Brain said, angrily. <br>

He pulled Rhett up then he took him upstairs, Juan faced Karin with a frown, she rolled and hissed. <br>

“I am ho**y right now and I need to fu**k someone” Karin thought and moved closer to Juan. <br>

She lay a finger on his lip and kissed him, Juan immediately pushed her away and told her to leave, she 
ignored him and began to undress herself when Brian appeared. He pushed her away instantly. <br>

“Leave” He said and pushed her out. <br>

He closed the door then faced Juan with a frown, Juan looked away and was about to leave when he stood in 
front of him. <br>

“Where do you think you are going” He asked with a frown. <br>

“I… ehm..I… wanna.. go and see Rhett” Juan said and ran upstairs. <br>

He shook his head and climbed the stairs up when he got upstairs, he met Juan sitting beside Rhett on the bed.
 Juan glanced at him and told him that he felt pity for him. <br>

“Same… I think there is reason why Sawyer rejected his feelings” Brian said,gazing at him. <br>

“I don’t think so” Juan said and got down on the bed . He looked at the window and was shocked to  see 
 Karin walking out of the gatekeeper’s room. He frowned. <br>

“She is a crazy b**h so she is h**y” Juan thought. <br>

Brian looked at the sky through the window, his mind drifted to Piper and a smile escaped his lips. 
Juan glanced at him and saw him smiling, he asked him the reason why he was smiling but he ignored him. <br>

“Mom, please stay with..me..don’t leave”’ <br>

They heard Rhett’s voice and turned back then they rushed to him, Brian held his hand while Juan touched his 
forehead. <br>

“He is sweating” Juan muttered. <br>

“On the A.C” Brian ordered. <br>

“It is on but why is he sweating?” Juan asked as he faced Brian. <br>

“I don’t know” Brian replied and sighed. <br>
