        When Rhett was done changing his clothes, he left the room with his friends, and they headed straight to the library. He was surprised to see Reese in the library,
         he walked inside and glanced at the person Reese was speaking to then he frowned when saw Sawyer. <br>
“Yo..you again” Rhett stuttered and Sawyer smirked. <br>
Reese asked if they knew themselves but they shook their heads and scoffed at the same , 
Sawyer narrated how they met to Reese then she chuckled. The two of them glanced at her and 
said “Its not funny” <br>
Juan and Brian greeted Reese, she smiled and rubbed their heads then they hugged her. 
Sawyer called Reese and she turned to her then she told Sawyer that Rhett is his cousin.
 Sawyer gasped when she heard what she said. Reese smiled and left the library, 
 Rhett  glared at Sawyer before walking away with his friends. <br>
“She looks pretty” Juan said, staring at Sawyer. <br>
“She is hugly… crazy b**ch” Rhett muttered. <br>
Rhett scoffed and told him that she is not pretty then Juan rolled, he told him he can’t know 
when a girl is pretty because he doesn’t have time for them. Rhett frowned and left the library, 
he went to the garden to get some fresh air, he was lost in his thoughts. <br>
Some minutes, he was staring at his mom’s pictures that were on his phone when his phone rang,
 Immediately he saw that it was his manager name that appeared on the screen, 
 he picked up and ask his manager named Mr. Wesley. He asked about the company then he told it is fine, 
 his dad came to the company and was furious because he didn’t meet him. <br>
“Okay, I don’t know what that evil man wants” Rhett said and hung up. <br>

At The Girls Hostel*** <br>

Karin was in the room, dressing up to go to class because she has a lecturer today when Susan came in. 
She asked Susan if she had class today and she nodded but she said she wanted to miss class today 
because Prof.Gavin class is boring to her. Karin smirked and put on her pink cap then she muttered
 “if not because I want to see Rhett, I won’t go to class today” <br>

Karin left the room, she was going to the class when she bumped into Sawyer. 
She frowned and pushed Sawyer away but she didn’t say anything. She walked away swaying her butt.
 Sawyer chuckled and ran to her then she dragged her hair, she slapped her. <br>
The students gasped, Sawyer glared at them and told them to continue what they are doing or
 else they are gonna  look crazy. Karin screamed and held her cheek, she glanced at Sawyer 
 who was smiling then she became more enraged, she raised her hand to slap Sawyer 
 when Prof.Gavin showed up. He told them to see him in his office Karin glared at Sawyer and left. <br>
“Sawyer, try to always calm your anger” Piper said. <br>
Sawyer told her it was Karin’s fault and she left when she got to Prof.Gavin’s office,
 she met Karin sitting on the chair. She glanced at both of them and she was like something
  is fishy between them, Prof.Gavin turned to Sawyer then he told Karin to apologise to her but
   Karin scoffed, she stood up and stomped out of the office. Sawyer told Prof. Gavin that 
   she is not serious and she doesn’t have respect then Prof.Gavin told her, she is his daughter. 
   Sawyer gasped and covered her mouth, he told her not to worry that she should leave, 
   she glanced at him then she left. <br>

When Sawyer got to the class, she spotted Piper and Mimi discussing, 
she sighed and went to meet them, she waved her hand at them . 
she got to where they were sitting. Taking a seat beside Mimi, 
she turned to them and apologized for causing trouble. <br>
“It’s okay, dear” Mimi said. <br>
Piper frowned and told her nothing is okay that she shouldn’t have done. <br> 
She always tells her to calm her anger but she won’t listen and always does whatever she wants. <br>
Mimi was about to say something when Prof.Gavin entered. <br>
“Good morning students” Prof. Gavin said. <br>
“Good morning, sir” The students greeted him back in unison. <br>
After some minutes, Prof.Gavin left the class and the students started murmuring.
 Juan went to meet Sawyer, he smiled at her and left. One of the students faced  
 Sawyer and told her not to fall for his trick that he is a playboy, she rolled
  and told her she is not gonna fall for his trick. She took her book and left with her friends. <br>
When they got to the hostel Mimi jumped on the bed, she smiled and said she missed the hostel
 that she doesn’t want to go to class today but Piper forced her to go. Sawyer pinched her cheek 
 and told her she is too lazy. <br>
“That’s what mom says to me” Mimi said and rolled. <br>
 Sawyer smiled as she faced Piper, she asked her if they have any food stuff at home
  and Piper shook her head then she asked if they should go to the restaurant but Mimi shook her head,
   she told them she is not going now, the only thing she wanna do now is to take a rest. <br>

At The Boys Hostel*** <br>

Rhett and his friends were discussing when they heard a knock on the door, 
Juan immediately rushed towards the door because he thought it was one of his sluts.
 When he opened the door, he met a lady facing her back at him. He smiled and tapped her
  when the girl saw him, she covered her eyes and he smirked then he asked her the reason
   why she covered her face, the girl asked him to cover his body. <br>
“Don’t you know this is the boys hostel” Juan said and she gasped. <br>
She apologised and was about to run away when he held her hand, he smiled and told her hands are soft,
 the girl rolled then she yanked her hand away. <br>
“Do you know that the teacher mustn't see you here?” He  asked and she nodded. <br>
She told him she lost her way and there is no one she could ask to show her girls hostel 
because she does not have any friends. Juan was surprised when he heard what she said. 
He was still speaking to the girl when Rhett showed up, he frowned at Juan and muttered
 “She is one of your b*ch” <br>
Juan shook his head sideways and told him she is not but Rhett
 didn’t believe so he turned to the girl and asked if they knew each other,
  the girls told him no. Rhett glanced at the both of them then he told the girl to leave. 
  Juan asked the girl’s name and she told him then she left. He went inside. <br>
Rhett and Brian  stared at him. <br>
“Bro, when will you stop all  this” Brain asked and he told them he didn’t do anything. <br>
“If you don’t know the girl then why are you speaking?” Rhett questioned. <br>
Juan asked if they don’t trust him again, Brain sighed and moved closer to him then
 he told him they trust him but Rhett shook his head, he told him, he didn’t trust him. <br>
“We just resumed  to the school, he already fu**k two girls… can’t he  stop being a playboy 
and focus on your life”Rhett said while standing up. <br>

He became enraged and told him to leave him alone, it is his life so he can do whatever he wants. 
Rhett told him to stop yelling at him and he doesn’t care about his life again then he lay down. 
Brian sighed and patted his back then he told him he shouldn’t have said that to Rhett but he scoffed. <br>
“I know he will be the one that you will support” he said and by saying that he stomped out of the room. <br>

Brian sighed heavily  and sat down on the bed, he called Rhett  but he was immersed in his thoughts deeply 
so he tapped him then he turned back. He asked him why he was so lost in thought but he didn’t say anything
 and walked to the minimum fridge. He took a bottle of water and gulped it, then he inhaled and exhaled. <br>

“Rhett, say something” Brian said and he said he had nothing to say about what happened today 
then he left the room. <br>

He went to the school library when he got there, he met Sawyer sitting alone, reading. He stared at her. <br>

“I think she is different from the other girls” His subconsciousness said. <br>

He was still staring at her when he heard someone calling Sawyer, he turned back
 and the person was Juan, he rolled. <br>
“I don't think she is different” He muttered and was about to leave when Juan called. <br>
He stopped walking and turned back, Juan apologised for yelling at him in the room, he nodded and left. <br>

“BUMP!!!” <br>

He bumped into someone on his way, when he raised his head, he frowned when he saw that bit 
was Karin that he bumped into. Karin smiled at her and held his hand then he yanked her hand away,
 he pushed her away. <br>

“Stay away from me” He said and left. <br>

Karin smirked and followed him, she called him while running after but he didn’t answer. 
After a minute she stopped and told herself she is gonna make him pay for what he does then she left. <br>

TBC.
