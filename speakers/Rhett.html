    <p>
        Immediately the car parked, the driver got down from the car and opened the door for a young handsome guy whose name is Rhett Roy. <br>

        He greeted him when Rhett stepped out of the car, the girls screamed and he rolled his pretty eyeballs.
       He gave them zero attention and a cold look, no smile on his face. <br>
       
       That's Rhett Roy for you. <br>
       
       When he got to the class, he sat down on the chair and thought of those girls that were screaming his name, he was lost in his thoughts not knowing when three girls 
       showed up in front of him, one of the girls tapped him and smiled. <br>
       
       He frowned and glared at her, “ You're ugly with that smile”. <br>
       
       He stood up and was about to walk out when the girl in the middle of the two girls held his hand, 
       he yanked it muttering something beneath his breath, “ Stay away from me!” <br>
       
       He was about to reach the class door when Professor Gavin entered, Karin and 
       her friends saw Professor Gavin, they went to their seats. 
       Rhett sighed and went to sit down on his seat, he brought out his phone and got himself busy with it,
        a guy entered class and sat down next to him. <br>
       
       Rhett glanced up to see who's sitting next to him, he saw his friend Brian, 
       the only guy that can stand his cold attitude. <br>
       
       “ Where is Juan?” Rhett asked. <br>
       
       “ He is in the room, he wanna skip class today” said Brian and Rhett nodded <br>
       
       He place his phone in his pocket and listened to whatever professor Gavin was saying <br>
       
       After some hours which look like an eternity, Prof.Gavin was done with the explanation,
        he asked them some questions and some of the students got the question right while some failed it. <br>
       
        Professor Gavin picked the class captain and ordered him to give him the names of everyone
         in the class then the class representative named Liam did as he instructed, 
         he was about to go and give Professor Gavin the list of the students when two girls entered. <br>
       
       “ Are you girls in this department?” Liam asked and they nodded. <br>
       
       “ Your name?” <br>
       
        The two girls exchanged glances and muttered something. <br>
       
       “ It was Prof.Gavin that asked me to give him the list of everyone 
       in the class” Liam said and they smiled. <br>
       
       “ Piper and Sawyer” <br>
       
       “ Is there still class today???” Piper asked and Liam shook his head then he left. <br>
       
       “ Let’s get out” Sawyer said. <br>
       
       “ Yeah ” Piper said with a nod then they left the class. <br>
       
        When they got to the hostel, they met a girl lying on the third bed, 
        they glanced at each other and Sawyer moved closer to the girl then tapped her. <br>
        The girl groaned as she slowly opened her eyes, she sat up and glanced at Sawyer and Piper. <br>
       
       “ Who are you??” Sawyer asked and she smiled <br>
       
       “ Hey, i’m Mimi and you” Mimi waved her hand and Sawyer rolled her eyeballs <br>
       
       She walked away and sat down on the bed and smirked. <br>
       
       “ Piper, should we go out?” Sawyer asked and Piper shook her head. <br>
       
       Mimi stares at them and gulps down her saliva. <br>
       
       “ I will go out, the atmosphere in the room is too boring" Mimi said and Sawyer glared at her. <br>
       
       “ I wasn't talking to you” said Sawyer and Mimi sighed and lay back on the bed. <br>
       
       “ Sawyer, don’t be harsh on her,,, i think she is nice” Piper said. <br>
       
       “ You sure??” She nodded <br>
       
       Sawyer got down from the bed and sat down on Mimi’s bed, she apologised for behaving that way and
        Mimi nodded and told her she understood then she pulled her in a hug. 
        Piper walked up to them and asked Mimi if they could be friends then Mimi nodded. <br>
       
       At The Boys Hostel*** <br>
       
       When Rhett and Brian got to the room, they met Juan their third friend
        and roommate f**king a lady on the bed. Rhett immediately turned back
         and shouted his name when Juan saw Rhett and Brian, he glanced at the girl
          and at his friends. He smirked and told the girl to leave, then the girl picked 
          up her clothes that were lying on the floor, she ran out of the room. <br>
       
       “ Don’t you ever come here again” Brain shouted. <br>
       
       Rhett frowned at Juan and he apologised and told them it was the girl
        that came here but Rhett ignored him and walked towards his stuff
         then he brought out a T-shirt. He put the T-shirt on the bed and
          undressed his clothes then wrapped a towel on his waist. He went to
           the washroom to take a shower. Brian glanced at the washroom door and 
           glanced at Juan, he frowned at him and sat down on the bed. Juan moved close
           r to him and apologised to him but Brian ignored him and put an headphone on his ear, he lay down. <br>
       
       “ Are you also ignoring me?” Juan sighed and removed the headphone. <br>
       
       Brian frowned and asked him the reason why he did that but Juan didn’t say anything so 
       he took his headphone and was about to put it on when Juan apologised again then he nodded. 
       He told him he is not more angry that he should apologise to Rhett but Juan shook his head and 
       told him that Rhett would never forgive him and he can’t stop being a playboy. <br>
       
       “ I guess you don’t want to change..” <br>
       
       His sentence was interrupted by Rhett. <br>
       
       “ You know he can’t change so we should leave him alone but know something,
        when next you miss a class, I'm gonna report you to your Dad” <br>
       
       “ That old man can’t do anything,” Juan said. <br>
       
       Brian was about to say something when Rhett’s phone rang, he picked his 
       phone and checked, he hung up immediately when he saw his dad name showing 
       on the screen then he put the phone back on the bed. He took the
        T- shirt that was on the bed and wore it then he took two notebooks. 
        Brian asked if he was going to the library so that they could go together
         and Rhett nodded. Then he told him he is going to a restaurant to get himself
          something to eat before he goes to the library then Braian told him they should go together.
           Juan also stood up and Rhett gave him a look that said “where is he going?’ <br>
       
       “I’m going with you guys of course” Juan replied and they left the room together. <br>
       On their way to the restaurant they bumped into Sawyer and Rhett frowned when he saw that it was a girl, 
       he glared at Sawyer and was about to leave when Sawyer held hand and told him to apologise. 
       He smirked and yanked her hand. Sawyer got angry, she dragged him back and pushed him on the floor.
        Rhett landed his butt on the floor. <br>
       
       “ When next you see me, you won’t behave like this again” Sawyer said and went to meet her friends. <br>
       
       Juan chuckled and Rhett glared at him as he stood, then he told his friend he was going back to the hostel.
        He was about to leave when Piper showed up and apologised for Sawyer then Rhett frowned. 
        He shouted at her to leave and Piper sighed then she apologised again. She left. <br>
       
       Rhett groaned and stomped his foot then he left.  <br>
       “ Do you wanna leave also?” Juan asked and Braian nodded, then he left. <br>
       
       “ I have no choice but to go back to the hostel” Juan said as he followed him. <br>
       
       At The Restaurant*** <br>
       When Sawyer and her friends got to the restaurant they ordered for what they wanted, Piper faced Sawyer, 
       she told she shouldn’t have done that and Sawyer rolled her eyes . <br>
       
       Mimi told Piper it was the guy’s fault so she should stop blaming Sawyer then Piper told them
        she knows but still she shouldn’t have done. <br>
       “ Can you please let’s  talk about something else?” Sawyer said. <br>
       “ Really, do you..” <br>
       Her sentence was interrupted by the waiter. <br>
       “ This is it ma’am” <br>
       The waiter placed the food and drinks on the table then he left. 
       Piper called Sawyer but she ignored her and started eating. <br>
       An hour later, they were done eating and they left the restaurant when they got outside, 
       Sawyer told them she wanted to visit the library and they nodded then she left. 
       Sawyer went straight to the college, she got to the college on time because the restaurant is
        not far to the college. When she got to the school, she saw two guys and a girl sitting together. 
        She took a seat and started solving some questions. She was still solving a question when a girl
         with blonde hair came in and sat next to her. <br>
       “Can’t you ask for permission before sitting with me” Sawyer frowned and raised her eyebrow then she laughed. <br>
       
       “Must I ask for permission before sitting with you?”  The girl said and she  nodded. <br>
       
       The girl stood up and took another sit and Sawyer glanced at her then she rolled her eyeballs. <br>
       
       Sawyer continued solving the question when she was done solving and she stared at it to ask herself
        if she got it. She was lost in her thoughts when the girl with blonde hair showed up again 
        and glanced at Sawyer’s note. She tapped her and told her that is not the answer. 
        Sawyer frowned at her and asked her to solve it. The girl took the pen and solved it as she explained 
        to her when the girl was done solving, Sawyer smiled and told her she was right then the girl nodded. 
        She told the girl to have a seat but the girl told her she was already leaving then she asked her name. <br>
       “I’m Reese and you” Reese smiled and Sawyer told her name. <br>
       Reese was about to leave when Rhett and his friend showed up, Rhett was surprised  to see Sawyer again. <br>
       “Yo.. u…You again” <br>
