        Rhett was in the living room discussing with his friends when they heard the doorbell, 
        he glanced at his friends and asked them if they were expecting anyone then they shook their heads. 
        He stood up and walked towards the door. When he opened the door, he met Karin standing In front of him.
         Karin smiled immediately when she saw him then she asked if she could go in but Rhett shook his head. <br>
“How did you know we are here?” Rhett asked and she bit her lips then she glanced at Juan. <br>

Rhett turned back and frowned at Juan. Karin used that opportunity to get inside, she sat down on the couch then she winked at Juan.
 He glared at her and asked her why she came here. She smiled and told him it was because of Rhett. <br>

“Karin,why are you here?” Rhett asked with a frown and she told it is because of him. <br>

Rhett sighed out loud and was about to climb the stairs up when Karin held him, 
he yanked his hand away and told her to stay away from him but she 
chuckled and muttered “You look more cute when you are angry” <br>

Rhett pushed her away and went upstairs when got upstairs, he took a shower and changed his clothes. 
After combing his hair, he took his car key and went out. When he got to the living room,
 he met Juan and Karin kissing, he glared at them as he walked out then Brian followed him. <br>

Rhett left the Mansion with Brian. Some minutes later, they got to the college and Rhett parked 
the car far from the entrance, he got down from the car with Brian. Immediately he got down he 
spotted Sawyer and her friends chatting and laughing, he smiled and stared at Sawyer. He was so 
lost staring at Sawyer that he didn’t hear Brian calling him. <br>

“He is staring at her again… is he in love with her” Brian thought and tapped him. <br>

“Ohh… you startle me” Rhett said and Brian smiled. <br>

“Can you stop staring at her and let’s go to the restaurant… I am starving” Brian said, gazing at him. <br>

He rolled and walked away. They were on their way to the restaurant when a girl bumped into them, 
the girl immediately apologized to them and ran away. Rhett and Brian exchanged glances then they left. 
When they got to the restaurant, they met Reese and a guy eating and discussing the project the Professor
 gave them. Rhett and Brian walked towards them and they sat down with them. <br>

“Don’t you guy have any…” <br>

His sentence was interrupted. <br>

“They are my friends” Reese said and the guy nodded then he glared at Rhett. <br>

Rhett smirked and ordered for what they wanted. Reese smiled and held the guy’s hand. <br>

“Who is he?” Rhett asked, pointing at the guy. <br>

“I’m her boyfriend” The guy said as he faced him. <br>

Rhett glanced at Reese and told her that her boyfriend is too arrogant,
 the guy was furious when he heard what Rhett said, he was about to hit Rhett 
 when Reese shouted his name, Roland stopped and sat down back. Rhett glared at him then
  Reese told him to apologise to Roland, he chuckled. <br>

“You know I will never do that, sis” Rhett said. <br>

Roland was shocked when he heard what Rhett called Reese, he immediately apologized to Rhett. <br>

“Roland, Rhett is my cousin… you thought I was cheating on you right” Reese said and he nodded slowly. <br>

Rhett stood up and told her, he lost his appetite then he left, Brian followed him. 
They headed straight to the library when they got there, he didn’t meet Sawyer, 
he glanced at her but no traces of her, he rubbed his hand on his head and told Brian that he is leaving. 
Brian smiled and told him that he knew he came here because of Sawyer and now he is disappointed because 
she wasn’t here. Rhett nodded and walked slowly away. When they got outside, the saw Piper speaking to a girl, 
Rhett called and went to meet her. <br>

“Hi, Piper… Where is Sawyer?” Rhett asked. <br>

“Oh, I think he likes Sawyer and I am in love with him” Piper thought. <br>

Rhett called her, drifting her out of her thoughts, she immediately faked a smile and told him, 
he doesn’t know where she is. Rhett knew she was lying, he nodded and left then he went to the girls hostel. 
When he got to the girls hostel, he saw a girl and asked her if she knew Sawyer’s room, the girl nodded and 
showed him. He knocked on the door and someone opened the door, he raised his head and met 
Mimi standing in front of him. Mimi gasped when she saw him, she was about to call Sawyer when
 Rhett covered her mouth. <br>

“Can you please give this to her and don’t tell her that it was me that gave her” Rhett said. <br>

“Mimi, who is at the door?” Sawyer asked. <br>

“Give me the necklace, I will pass it to her” Mimi said and collected it then he left. <br>

Girls Hostel*** <br>

Sawyer dressed up and was about to leave the room when Mimi called and told her she has something to give her.
 She brought out the necklace Rhett gave to her. Sawyer gasped when she saw the neck and Mimi asked if 
 she loved it then she nodded, she collected the necklace from her. She put it on and left the room, 
 Mimi smiled and went to the kitchen to prepare what she would. She was cooking when she heard a knock
  on the door. <br>

“Who could it be” She thought and went to open the door. <br>

When she opened the door, she met Juan standing in front of her, she frowned and asked him the reason 
why he was here, he ignored her then he walked in. He glanced around and sat down on Sawyer’s bed,
 Mimi immediately pushed him away then she told him not to sit on the bed, she pulled out a chair for him.
  He sat down on the chair. <br>

“So, why are you here?” She asked. <br>

“I’m here for you, babe” Juan said with a smirk. <br>

“Juan, I already told you that I don’t love you” She said as she folded her hands beneath her br**t. <br>

Juan stood up and moved closer but she moved backward, he started moving closer and she moved backwards, 
she wasn’t looking back then she hit her back on the wall. He smiled and at her, he touched her chin, then 
 he closed his eyes to kiss her when she pushed him away. He laughed and she was confused. <br>

“Why are you laughing?” She asked. <br>

“I’m leaving… see you later” Juan said as he walked towards the door. <br>

He waved his hand at her and left then she sighed out loud. <br>

At Night*** <br>

Sawyer put on Pajamas and she laid on the bed. She was about to sleep when Piper entered, she greeted her
 and she responded. Some minutes later she was discussing with Piper when her phone rang, she checked the 
 name on the screen but it was an unknown number, she hung up and put the phone on the bed. <br>

“Sawyer, I think you should pick the call” Piper said. <br>

“I don’t know the person” Sawyer said and Piper told her to pick it up when she picked it up. <br>

“Hello” The person said. <br>

“Hello… who are you?” She asked but the person say anything so she hung and lay down back. <br>

Piper asked her about the person that called her and she told she didn’t know who it was. She yawned 
and slept, Piper also closed her eyes. An hour later Sawyer woke up and brought out her computer and a note 
then she started studying. She kept on yawning while studying, her eyes not living the system when she was
 thirsty , she stood up and walked towards the minimum fridge to get herself a bottle of water, she gulped. 
 She was about to drop the bottle water when she heard Mimi muttering “I wanna drink water”  <br>

She smiled and woke her up, Mimi groaned as she opened her eyes, she glanced around and asked if they are
 in the morning but Sawyer shook her head, she gave her the bottle of water. Mimi was confused. <br>

“I am not thirsty” Mimi said and she told her she heard her saying she wanna drink water. <br>

“Oh, I am sorry for stressing” Mimi said. <br>

She nodded and sat down on the chair,she continued studying while Mimi slept back. <br>

“I need to prepare very well before the test” She thoughts. <br>

Some minutes later, she was still studying when her mind drifted to her ex boyfriend Kingston, she sighed out
 loud and tears streamed down her face when she remembered what he did to her. She immediately wiped the tears
  away and shut down her laptop then she lay down on the bed to sleep but she couldn’t, she stood up again and
   went to the washroom to take a shower when she was done, she put her pajamas and lay down on the bed again,
    she packed her hair. She glanced at her friends who were already asleep, she sighed. <br>

“I need to force myself to sleep “ She said as she closed her eyes tightly and forced herself to sleep 
then she dozed off. <br>

TBC. <br>
