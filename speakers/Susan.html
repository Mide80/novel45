        BRJ’S MANSION*** <br>

At night Rhett and Juan were busy discussing when Brian climbed the stairs down, he sat down on the couch
 and stared at the both of them then they asked him the reason why he is staring at them, he shook his head.
  Brian asked if they shook go to the club, Juan shook his head and told them he is tired for today.
   Rhett on the other hand wishes to go to the club so that he could clear his mind but he knows 
   if he tells his friends, they are gonna be surprised. Seems he got no choice he told them and 
   they were surprised, Juan blinked his eyes twic eye. He stared at him. <br>

“Why are you guys staring at me?” Rhett asked. <br>

“We are surprised… Rhett, you have never said you will go to a club with us before” Juan said. <br>

“I hope you are okay, bro” Brian said and touched his head. <br>

“Guys, I am fine… are you ready to go or not” Rhett asked,gazing at them. <br>

Brian and Juan exchanged glances then they nodded. <br>

They left.

Some hours later they got to the club, most of the students in Clemson University came to the club, loud
 music playing, he could see everyone dancing , some were having fun while some guys were smoking and the
  girls were sitting on the laps. Rhett glanced at them and frown, he saw a sit at a dark place. <br>

“Guys, I wanna go and sit down” He said and left. <br>

Juan and Brian were glancing around when a girl appeared, she smiled at Juan and he returned the smile,
 she moved closer to him then kissed him. <br>

“You guys should get a room” Brian muttered and Juan rolled. <br>

“See you later, bro” Juan said, walking away with the girl. <br>

Rhett was sitting in a dark place, he was staring at everyone, he was about to stand up when Sawyer and her
 friends entered. <br>

“Oh, she is here” He muttered. <br>

He stared at her and smiled, he smoked the cigarette in his hand. He glanced at Sawyer again and he saw a
 drunk guy forcing himself on her. He got angry and stood up to meet Sawyer when he saw her raising her 
 hand to slap the guy. Everyone gasped when Sawyer slapped  the guy. The guy stood up and was about to slap 
 her back when Rhett held his hand. <br>

“Leave my hand… I need to deal with this bi**h” The guys yanked his hand away. <br>

“Do you wanna hit a woman? You know if you hit her you are dead” Rhett said and faced him. <br>

The guy scoffed. <br>

“I will make sure you pay for this” The guy said and stomped out. <br>

“Rocky” His friend called, running after him. <br>

Sawyer faced Rhett and glared at him but he smiled at her. <br>

“I know you wanna thank me but don’t worry” Rhett said with a smile. <br>

“Do you think I wanna thank you for this? No… I don’t need your help, why are you poking your nose
 into my business? Rhett, can you please stay away from me, I don’t want anything to do with you”
  Sawyer said and walked out. <br>

Rhett ran after her when he got outside he held her, she turned back. She yanked her hand and glared at him 
then she muttered on under her breath “Stay away from me, Rhett” <br>

“Tell me the reason why you hated me so much… Sawyer, I truly love you” Rhett said. <br>

His tears were on the verge of falling, she turned around and walked away, he ran towards her then he stood in
 front of her. She became more enraged and pushed him away. <br>

“There is a reason why I don’t wanna have anything to do with you… Stay away from me, I don’t love you”
 She yelled and left. <br>

He stared at Sawyer as she walked away then tears rolled down his cheek. He sat down on the floor, sobbing. <br>

“Mom, she is leaving” He muttered. <br>

Brian and Juan called him when they got outside, he glanced at them then they moved closer to him.
 They felt sorry for him, Brian tapped his shoulder. <br>

“Rhett, let’s go” Brian said and he shook his head. <br>

“I need to see Sawyer” He said as he stood up. <br>

Brian and Juan held his hand then they told him not to go but he refused, he yanked her hand away.
 Juan gave Brian an eye signal to knock him off then he did, they carried him into the car. <br>

****** <br>

When Sawyer and her friends got home, they turned to Sawyer frowning their faces, she hissed and walked 
to the minimum fridge, she took a bottle of water then gulped it. She inhaled and exhaled. Piper held her 
hand and she turned to her. <br>

“What is the meaning of this Sawyer? How could you do that to Rhett? Don’t you have any human feelings at all”
 Piper yelled. <br>

“Keep the trash…do you know what I have gone through before? You guys should leave me alone, 
I want to stay alone” Sawyer said in tears. <br>

She wiped her tears away and stomped out. <br>

“Sawyer, you can’t go out now… it’s late” Mimi said and ran after her. <br>

Piper smirked and smiled. <br>

“She should stop hurting my crush, I don’t care about whatever she has gone through” Piper thought. <br>

Some minutes later, Sawyer entered the room with Mimi, she glanced at Piper who didn't even care about her.
 Piper and Mimi lay on the bed and doze off. Sawyer  lay on her bed to sleep but she couldn’t sleep. 
 She stood up and sat down on a chair, she brought her book then she started reading. At 10pm she 
 stopped reading, she brought her phone to watch a movie on Netflix when she heard Mimi’s talking 
 while sleeping. <br>

“I think she is dreaming” She thought and smiled. <br>

Her mind drifted to Rhett and sighed out loud. <br>

“Rhett, I know you will start hating me but I don’t… we can’t be together, I don’t want what happened in 
the past should happen again”’She muttered. <br>

She stood and lay on her bed then she slept. <br>

The Next day, Sawyer was the first person to wake up despite the fact she slept later, she managed to open
 her eyes then she got down on the bed. She undressed her Pajamas after that she entered the bathroom to
  take her bath and brush. When she was done she came out of the toilet with a towel wrapped on her body.
   She glanced at her friends and woke them up, they groaned as they opened their eyes. <br>

“Good morning, girls” She greeted them with a smile. <br>

Mimi responded and Piper hissed as she walked into the bathroom, she sighed out loud. <br>

“Don’t feel sad, I will talk to her” Mimi said as she got down on the bed. <br>

She nodded and dressed up. <br>

Two hours later, they were all done, then they headed to the class for today’s lecture. When they got 
to college, they sat down. Sawyer was busy reading a novel when Rhett and his friends entered the class,
Sawyer looked up and her eyes met with Rhett, she immediately looked away. Rhett walked towards her,
 he stared at her and remove the strands of her hair then he walked away, a smile escaped Sawyer’s lips. <br>

“Sawyer, don’t tell me that you are falling for him” Her subconsciousness said. <br>

“No” She said and shook her head. <br>

Mimi glanced at her and asked who she was speaking to. <br>

“Did I say that out loud, oh shit” She said and smacked her head. <br>

Mimi chuckled and she glared at her. <br>

Minutes later, the class was done then they students started leaving the class one after the other. 
Mimi sighed out loud and smiled. <br>

“I am so happy we are done with today’s class” Mimi muttered. <br>

“Yeah but don’t forget our test is coming soon” Sawyer said and she frowned. <br>

She told her she hates tests and Sawyer smacked her head. Piper stood up and left the class without waiting
 for them, Sawyer and Mimi exchanged glances then they left the class. <br>

“Piper” Sawyer called as she ran after her but she ignored them. <br>

“Sawyer, give her some space okay” Mimi said, gazing at her. <br>

She felt sad and nodded slowly. <br>

AT MR ROY’S MANSION*** <br>

Mr Roy was in the living room, smoking when his personal bodyguard entered, he greeted him and he responded. 
He blew out the smoke of the cigarette and dropped the cigarette into the ashtray. <br>

“Mike, what do you find out about my son?” He asked, gazing at him. <br>

“Boss…I haven’t found out anything about him” Jimmy said, having his eyes glued to the floor. <br>

Mr Roy frowned and gave him three days to find out what Rhett has been doing in college and about his
 company or else he is gonna kill him, Mike apologised then he told him, he would do it. <br>

“You can leave” Mr Roy said and he nodded then he left. <br>

“That little boy doesn’t want me to enter his company… I will make sure I ruin his company, I don’t
 care if he is my son or not” Mr Roy thought and lightened another cigarette. <br>

He started smoking. <br>

TBC. <br>
