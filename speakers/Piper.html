        At Mr  Miller’s Mansion.*** <br>

        When Mr Miller got home, he met Shirly eating at the dinning. Immediately Shirly saw him, 
        she called him and ran towards him then she hugged him, Mr Miller smiled at her and lifted her up, 
        she pecked her dad, she told him to put her down. He did as she said and he asked about her mom, 
        she told him, she is upstairs. He nodded and was about to climb the stairs up when Mrs Miller appeared, 
        she smiled and hugged him then she about his work. He sighed out loud and told her that the R2 Company
         in  America doesn't want them to work together. Then she told him not to worry, he nodded and removed
          his tie. She told him to go upstairs  to have a shower, he went upstairs. <br>
        
        An hour later Mrs Miller was serving the meal on the table when her husband climbed
         the stairs down, he kissed his wife and sat down on the table then he asked about his daughter.
          She told him that she was asleep. <br>
        
        “I hope she didn’t stress you today” Mr Miller said as he ate. <br>
        
        Mrs Miller shook her head and told she didn’t stress her but she is sad because she misses
         Sawyer so much then he told her not to worry that as time goes on she would forget about it,
          she nodded and sat down. They were eating when Mr Miller told his wife that he called Sawyer 
          and he thought she was not happy because she was sobbing when  he called her. <br>
        
        “Why? I need to speak with her” Mrs Miller said and was about to stand up when he held her hand 
        then he told her not to worry that she will be fine. <br>
        
        “Don’t worry she will be fine” Mr Miller said reassuringly. <br>
        
        Mrs Miller just nodded and sat down back, she wished she could just call Sawyer and asked her 
        why she was sobbing when her dad called her. After some minutes they were done eating and 
        Mrs Miller told the maids to clear the table then she went upstairs with her husband. 
        When they got to the room they had some discussion then they slept. <br>
        
        At Clemson’s University*** <br>
        
        Sawyer put on her pyjamas and lay down on the bed. She was about to sleep when Piper called and 
        asked her the reason why she left the restaurant but she couldn’t say anything, she was only staring
         at the ceiling. Piper tapped her and told her she shouldn’t if she doesn’t want them to discuss about, 
         she nodded then they slept. <br>
        
        The next day, Sawyer was the first person to wake up, she entered the bathroom to take her bath when
         she was done bathing,she woke Piper and Mimi but Mimi didn’t answer, she told them she is not attending 
         any class today, Piper entered the bathroom and Sawyer dressed up, she work a baggy clothes and a jeans
          trouser, she took her cap and used it when Piper walked out of the bathroom, she was surprised to see 
          Mimi still laying on bed. <br>
        
        “Mimi, do you really mean what you said… won’t you attend the computer science class?” She asked as 
        she dressed up. <br>
        
        Mimi nodded <br>
        
        “His class is too boring” Mimi said. <br>
        
        Sawyer told her  if she doesn't go to the class, she is gonna miss a lot of marks in the test. 
        She immediately stood up and told them she doesn’t want to lose a mark in her test. <br>
        
        After some minutes, they left the hostel when they got to class, they sat down on the seats, 
        Mimi brought out the assignment and started doing while Sawyer and Piper gossip. 
         Their gossip came to a halt when Prof.Gavin entered the class, silence fell over the class. <br>
        
        “Some of you submitted the assignment while some didn't,” Prof.Gavin said. <br>
        
        Immediately Mimi heard what she said, she glanced at Sawyer and sighed, Prof. Gavin called Mimi and
         Karin and asked them the reason why they didn’t submit their project. Mimi was speechless, 
         she regretted not doing his assignment while Karin rolled and told him she didn’t have time to do it. 
         Prof.Gavin frowned and told them he is gonna reduce their test marks, tears rolled down on Mimi’s cheek, 
         she ran out of the class. She was running to the garden when she bumped into Brian she immediately apologised
          to him and ran away. <br>
        
        “What is wrong with her?” Brian thought and followed her. <br>
        
        He met her sobbing in the garden and he sat down next to her. He asked her the reason why she was sobbing but
         she burst into more tears. He told her to stop sobbing and tell him what happened to her, she wiped her 
         tears away then she narrated everything to him. Brian felt so sorry for her and at the same time, he 
         blamed her that she was the one that was not serious. He wiped her tears away and consoled her then he
          hugged her. Some minutes later, they disengaged and Mimi thanked him, she stood up and was about to leave
           when Brian called her then he asked if they could be friends, she nodded and he smiled. He left her hand
            and she left. <br>
        
        When she got to the class, she met her friends in the class waiting patiently for her, they hugged 
        her immediately they saw her and she smiled at them. Piper asked if she is okay and she nodded then 
        Sawyer told them, she already pleaded on her behave on Prof. Gavin then told her, he won’t reduce her
         mark again but she should change. Mimi smiled and hugged her tightly. <br>
        
        “Cutie pie, you’re hurting me” Sawyer muttered. <br>
        
        “I’m sorry” She apologised and moved back. <br>
        
        “When did you give her that nickname?” Piper asked, sounding jealous. <br>
        
        “Just now.. Don’t tell me you are jealous” Sawyer said and she rolled. <br>
        
        Sawyer smiled and told her she is gonna give her a nickname too and she thought of 
        a nickname she could give her. <br>
        
        “How about Lovey?” She asked and Piper told her she loves it then she hugged her. <br>
        
        They were walking out of the class when Rhett called Sawyer, she turned when she saw Rhett,
         she frowned and ignored him. He called her again as he stood up then he walked towards her.
          He held her hand and she yanked it away.He told her to give him a chance. <br>
        
        “I don’t have nothing to discuss with you” She said andleft with her friends. <br>
        
        They were going to the hostel when they heard someone calling Mimi and they stopped walking then 
        they turned back. Brian walked  towards them. <br>
        
        “Hi Girls” He said and waved his hand at them then they responded. <br>
        
        “Mimi, can we go for lunch together” Brain asked, gazing at her. <br>
        
        Mimi glanced at her friends and Piper gave her an eye signal to go with him while Sawyer was only 
        staring at them without saying anything, Piper tapped her and she nodded then Mimi left with Brian. 
        Sawyer and Piper went to the hostel together when they got inside, Piper jumped on the bed while Sawyer 
        took a small chair that was beside her bed and sat down. <br>
        
        “When did Mimi become friends with Brian” She asked and Piper told her she didn’t know then she nodded. <br>
        
        “Sawyer, let’s go to the grocery store to get food stuff, i am starving but i don’t want to go to the 
        restaurant” Piper said and Mimi stood up then she told her, they should go then they left. <br>
        
        They were on their way to the grocery store when they bumped into Karin and her friends, Piper a
        pologised to them while Sawyer rolled. Karin glared at her and left with her friends then Piper asked her 
        the reason why she didn’t apologise to them and she frowned. <br>
        
        “Why should I apologise to them… it’s Karin’s fault so stop blaming me” She said as she entered the grocery 
        store leaving her. <br>
        
        At Mr Roy’s Mansion*** <br>
        
        Mr Roy entered Rhett's company, he asked the Manager about Rhett and Mr Wesley told him he is still 
        in his school. He frowned and told him to call him that he wanted to speak with her then 
         Mr Wesley did as he said. He called Rhett but he didn’t pick, Mr Roy became enraged when heard what 
         he said. He was about to enter Rhett’s office when Mr Weseley stood in front of him and told him he 
         can’t enter there. <br>
        
        “Why can’t I enter my son’s office?” Mr Roy asked with a frown. <br>
        
        “Sorry, sir but that is the rules.. No one is allow to enter here” Mr. Wesley said. <br>
        
        “But it’s…” <br>
        
        His sentence was interrupted., <br>
        
        “I know, I am not allow to enter there” <br>
        
        He left the company angrily and Mr Wesley followed him. When he got outside, he entered his car and 
        the driver drove off. Mr Wesely  rubbed his hair and he walked towards the security man, who was standing
         beside the gate. He told him not to allow Mr.Roy to enter the company or else his job is done. 
         The security man nodded. <br>
        
        “I promise not to allow him here again” The security  man said, having his eyes glued to the floor.  <br>
        
        Mr Wesley nodded and entered the company. <br>
        
        TBC.
