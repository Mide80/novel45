        Two days later, Sawyer was still laying on the bed when Piper came out of the water, 
        she glanced at Piper and Mimi. She was surprised to see them already getting ready for college. <br>

“You guys are already getting ready for today’s lecture… we still have a lot of time, why are you
 getting ready now” She asked. <br>

Piper and Mimi exchange. <br>

“We are having class by 9:30a.m this morning and the time is 9a.m” Mimi said, gazing at her. <br>

“What?” She exclaimed. <br>

“You better hurry up” Piper said and she glared at them. <br>

She immediately got down from the bed, she rushed to the bathroom and took her bath. Few seconds later, 
she came out of the bathroom and got dressed. She put on pink baggy clothes and a Jean trouser, she didn’t 
bother to pack her hair. She combed her hair and put on her sneakers, she picked some books she would need
 then she carried her bag. <br>

“Done” She said and sighed out loud. <br>

“Must you put on baggy clothes?” Mimi muttered and she rolled. <br>

She check the time and it just 9:25a.m <br>

“We have only five minutes” She said and they left the room then they locked the door. <br>

Some minutes later, when they got to the class  they met a few of the students in the class, they took a seat
 and sat down. Sawyer was busy with her phone when Rhett and his friends entered the class, the students
  complimented as usual, Sawyer hissed out loud. The students faced her and she glared at them then they 
  looked away. <br>

Rhett glanced at Sawyer and she smirked, Piper smiled at Rhett, he smiled back at her. <br>

A minute later, Prof.Gavin entered the class with a frown. <br>

“Good morning, sir” The students greeted in unison. <br>

“What is good about this morning? Have you all seen your test mark, 88 percent of you failed the test” 
Prof.Gavin said. <br>

“Oh, we haven’t check our test mark” Mimi said in a whisper. <br>

“Don’t worry, we would go and check it immediately after we are done with the lecture” Sawyer whispered. <br>

“Sawyer, get up” Prof.Gavin said. <br>

“I didn’t…” <br>

Her sentence was interrupted. <br>

“Who were you speaking with?” Prof.Gavin asked with a frown. <br>

She glanced at her friends and shook her head sideways. <br>

“Nobody sir”’ She said and Prof.Gavin sent her  out of the class. <br>

She walked sluggishly out, Rhett felt pity for her and raised his hand then he told Prof. Gavin, he has 
something to say. He told him that he was listening. <br>

“Give her another chance sir” Rhett said and he glared at him. <br>

He told him to keep quiet. <br>

Rhett did as he said, he glanced at Sawyer who was resting her back at the wall, he sighed out loud. <br>

An hour later Prof.Gavin was done and he called Liam, the representative. Liam stood up and faced him then he
 told him to see him in his office. <br>

“Okay, Sir” Liam said with a nod. <br>

Prof.Gavin left. <br>

immediately Prof.Gavin left the students started leaving one after the door, Piper was happy when Prof.Gavin 
sent Sawyer out while Mimi frowned. She stood up and carried her bag, they left. <br>

When they got outside they met Rhett speaking with a Sawyer but she ignored him. Mimi called her and
 she smiled then she walked towards them leaving Rhett. <br>

“How was today’s class?” Sawyer asked with a smile. <br>

“It was…” <br>

Her sentence was interrupted. <br>

“It was fine, babe” Rhett said and she glared at him. <br>

Piper glanced at Rhett and felt pity for him, she asked Sawyer if they can go and check their test marks, 
she nodded. <br>

They walked away. <br>

Rhett ruffled his hair and sighed out, he stared at Sawyer and she walked away, he was lost staring at her
 that he didn’t notice when Karin appeared. <br>

“Babe” Karin called with a smile. <br>

She was about to say something when he walked away. He went to meet his friends, he met Juan staring at his 
phone smile. <br>

“What are you staring at that make you smile?” He asked as he sat down with him. <br>

When Brian heard Rhett’s voice, he switched off his phone and face him. He asked him if he is done spoking
 with Sawyer and he nodded. <br>

They left the class. <br>

“Where is Juan?” Rhett asked when they were about to enter the car. <br>

“He might be with one of his b**ch” Brian replied. <br>

They entered the car and the driver drove off. <br>

BRJ’S MANSION***

Some hours later they got to the Mansion, they didn’t see anyone at the Mansion and the door was opened. 
Rhett and Brian exchanged glances, they climbed the stairs up when they got upstairs they heard a girl

moaning out loud from Juan’s room. Rhett frowned and opened the door angrily, he met Juan fu**king a lady. 
He glanced at the girl and it turned out to be Karin’s third friend whose name is Susan. <br>

“Juan” He shouted and Juan turned back. <br>

He glanced at Rhett and winked at him while Rhett glared at him and walked out of the room. He went to the 
living room and brought out his phone. <br>

“Rhett,don’t mind him… you know he can never change” Brian said as he sat down. <br>

“Is that the reason why he left immediately when we are done with the lecture?” Rhett said with a frown. <br>

They were busy talking when they heard some voices. Juan and Susan climbed the stairs down. <br>

“Bye, babe… see you next time” Susan said and kissed him. <br>

“Can you please leave” Rhett said and Susan glared at him then she left. <br>

“She’s fu**king loose” Juan muttered. <br>

“Then why did you have s*x with her” Brian said and he rolled. <br>

Rhett glared at the both of them and was about to climb the stairs up when Juan stood in front of him. <br>

“I’m sorry… don’t call my dad” Juan said with a pout. <br>

Brian chuckled and Rhett glared at him then he told him it is not funny. <br>

He gave him two chances to rectify his behavior issues after that  he was gonna report him to his 
dad then he went upstairs. Juan rubbed his hands through his hair and sat down on the couch. <br>

AT MR MILLER’S MANSION*** <br>

Shirley was sitting at the dining table staring at the food her mother placed on the table. 
She couldn’t eat because the boy she was crushing on in school rejected her when she confessed her
 feelings to him. Her mother glanced at her and walked towards her. She asked her the reason why she is
  so sad. <br>

“Why are you not happy sweetie” Mrs Miller asked, gazing at her. <br>

She didn’t say anything. <br>

“Honey, can you please tell me” Mrs Miller said. <br>

“Mom, I have a crush on a boy in my school” Shirley said. <br>

“Really, who is it?” Mrs Miller said, gazing at her. <br>

She told her mom she confessed her feelings to him but she was rejected and Mrs Miller bit her lips. <br>

“Is that the reason you aren’t happy” Mrs Miller asked and she nodded. <br>

Mrs Miller told her not to worry that he is gonna come to her, she nodded slowly. She smiled and hugged her
 mom then Mrs Miller told her to eat. <br>

“What’s the name of your crush?” Mrs Miller asked with a smile. <br>

“Draven” She said and blush. <br>

“Did you just blush?” Mrs Miller asked and she looked away. <br>

Some hours later, Mr Miller came in, Shirley ran to him and hugged. Mr Miller lifted her up then kissed her
 forehead, he asked about her school and students. <br>

“It was fine” She muttered. <br>

Mrs Miller came out of the kitchen, she greeted her number then they kissed. Shirley closed her
 eyes and her parents smiled at her. Mr Miller told her to open her eyes, she did as he said and he 
 pinched her cheek. <br>

“You look pretty” Mr Miller said. <br>

“Thanks, daddy” She said in her tiny little voice. <br>

Mrs Miller told him  that she has a boyfriend and Mr Miller glanced at her then he put her on the couch. <br>

“A boyfriend?”  <br>

She shook her head and told him, the boy is her crush and not her boyfriend. Mr Miller smiled. <br>

“Is the boy from America?” Mr Miller asked and she shook her head. <br>

She told him that the boy is Korean. <br>

“Huh” Mr Miller uttered. <br>

He glanced at his wife and she smiled at him. Shirley got down from the chair then she ran upstairs. <br>

“Be careful sweetie” Mrs Miller said and she nodded.

Mrs Miller moved closer to her husband and helped him to remove his tie then they kissed again. She told 
him, she is done cooking and his food is on the table. <br>

“Okay… I need to take a shower first” Mr Miller said and she nodded then he went upstairs. <br>

Mrs Miller sat down on the couch and switched on the television. After some minutes Mr Miller can down stair
s then sat down on the dining chair, Mrs Miller pulled out a chair, she sat down next to her husband. <br>

“What is the reason R2’s company doesn't want to work with your company?” She asked as she chewed the 
food in her mouth. <br>

Mr Miller told her he didn't know and she nodded slowly. <br>

“Don’t worry, very soon… they're gonna accept a partnership with your company” She said. <br>

“Thanks, honey” Mr Miller said and removed the strands of her hair then he kissed her. <br>

“You guys are kissing again” Shirley said as she closed her eyes. <br>

“Why haven’t you slept honey?” She asked, gazing at her. <br>

She told her that she couldn’t sleep so Mrs Miller stood up and went to her room together. 
When they got to the room, she lay her on the bed and sang her lullaby, she yawned then she dozed off. <br>

“Good night, sweetie”  She said and kissed her forehead. <br>

She was about to leave when she saw her husband in front of the door, she smiled and moved closer to him. 
Mr Miller wrapped his hand on her neck and then they went to their room. <br>
