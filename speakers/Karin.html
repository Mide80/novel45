        Clemson University***

Immediately Rhett and his friends got down from the girls compliment them as usual, he smirked 
and walked to the class with his friends, getting to the class, he met Karin and her friends with
 few of the students in the class. He thought of Sawyer and was about to leave the class Prof.Gavin entered,
  he sat down on the chair then Brian told him not to get worried that she’s gonna come for lecture today, 
  he nodded. <br>

“Good morning” Prof.Gavin greeted and they responded. <br>

Prof.Gavin was about to start the clas when Sawyer and her friends showed, they greeted him but he glared at
 them and asked them the reason why they were just coming, Mimi explained the reason why they were late. 
 He asked her to shut up, that they don’t have any excuses, then he asked them to leave. Sawyer and her
  friends were about to walk out when Rhett stood up. <br>

“Sir, can you please pardon them for today” Rhett said and Prof.Gavin glared at him then he told him to sit. <br>

Rhett stood up and left the class, Pro.Gavin was furious so he asked him not to enter his class again. When Rhett
 got outside, she met Sawyer resting her back at the wall. He called her but she didn’t  hear because she was 
 lost in her thoughts so he tapped her then she frowned. <br>

“Instead of you being in class and studying, you came out… I don’t think you like your studies” Sawyer said 
and glared at him. <br>

“I did this…” <br>

His sentence was interrupted. <br>

“Shush, I already tell you that I don’t have any feelings for you…stay away from me”  <br>

By saying that she walked away leaving him speechless, Rhett glanced at Sawyer’s friends and they 
looked away, he rubbed his hair and went to the toilet. When he got there, he rinsed his face and 
stared at himself in the mirror, then he sighed out loud. <br>

“Why don’t you leave her? She doesn’t love you” His subconsciousness said. <br>

“No, I won’t… she is mine” He said and left. <br>

When he got outside, he met the students already leaving the class, he entered the class. 
Immediately he saw Prof. Gavin, he rolled his eyes, then he went to meet his friends. He told
 them they should leave and that he wanted to visit the library then he parked his stuff. He was about
  to walk away when Brian held his hand and asked if he was going there because of Sawyer, he sighed and
   nodded. <br>

“Bro, why are you forcing yourself on her? she doesn’t love you” Juan said but he ignored them and left. <br>

He headed straight to the library when he got there, he saw Sawyer in front of the shelf, stretching her hand
 as she tried to take a book she needed but her hand couldn’t reach there so he walked closer to her. 
 She suddenly froze as soon as she accidentally inhaled his fragrance. <br>

“Huh!!!” <br>

She tilted her neck to see him staring at her, she snapped her hand drifting him out of his thoughts, 
he stretched and gave the book to her. <br>

“You need this??” He asked and she frowned then she told him she doesn’t need it anymore, she left. <br>

He sighed and followed, he called running after but she ignored her, he later caught up with her.
 He held his hand and she immediately yanked his hand away then she faced him, she folded her hands
  beneath her breast. He stared at her and couldn’t say anything. <br>

“Why did you keep showing me your ugly face? She muttered. <br>

He took some deep breaths before speaking. <br>

“Sawyer, I love…” <br>

His sentence was interrupted. <br>

“But I don’t love you… go and find someone to fall in love with those girls that are crushing” She said and 
he shook his head. <br>

“Believe me, I am not like this but I don’t know how it happened… It may be because you are different from
 the other girls” <br>

 He said, gazing at her. <br>

She asked if he was done blabbing and he nodded slowly then she walked away in front of him.
 He stared at her as she walked away, he was so lost staring at her that he didn’t notice that
  Karin was standing beside her. Karin frowned when he saw him staring at her and she tapped her. <br>

“Can you please stay away from me? You are not my type” <br>

He muttered under his breath and left. <br>

The School Garden*** <br>

Brian was at the school garden, listening to a song when Mimi showed up and she sat down next to him. 
She called him but he didn’t hear so she removed the headphone then he faced her. 
She hissed in anger and he asked her the reason why she is angry. <br>

“Brian, tell Juan to stay away from him… I don’t like him” Mimi said, angrily. <br>

“Huh” <br>

Mimi glanced at him and told him she is in love with him and that she doesn’t have any feelings for Juan. 
He rolled and told her, he doesn’t fall in love easily so he doesn’t love her. She was so sad and at the same
 time she was happy because he told her, she nodded and then she was about to get up when Juan showed up. 
 She glanced at Brian and at Juan then she stood up. <br>

“Bye” She said and left. <br>

Juan smirked and sat down with Brian, he asked him the reason why she was here but he glared at him and 
stood up, he held his hand. <br>

“Juan, do you love Mimi or you wanna fu**k and later dump her” Brian asked as he faced him. <br>

Juan smiled and rolled. <br>

“The truth is I am only after her pu**y… she is so pretty, bro” Juan said with a smile. <br>

“You will never change” said Brian as he walked out of the garden then he followed her. <br>

They were going to the Library to meet Rhett when they saw Piper. A smile escaped Brian’s lips when he saw her,
 he walked towards her, Juan was confused when he saw Brian smiling. <br>

“Did he love her or Mimi?” He thought. <br>

Brian called Piper when he got to her, she faked a smile and waved at him. He asked if they can go to the 
restaurant together and she shook her head then she told she has something to do at the hostel. <br>

“Okay” Brian said and left with Juan. <br>

They went to the Library when they got to the library they didn’t meet Rhett so they went home. An hour later,
 when they got to the Mansion, they met Rhett, drinking. <br>

“I don’t think he is in a good mood” Juan whispered into Brian’s ear and he nodded. <br>

“Hey, Rhett” Juan shouted in order to garner his attention towards him. <br>

Rhett glanced at them and continued drinking, Brian walked closer to him and collected the drink away from you.
 He stretched his hand to collect the drink but Brian gave it to Juan then he gulped it. <br>

“You guys should leave me… I wanna be alone” He said and stood up but  he stumbled. <br>

“Why are you drinking? You even drink to the extent that you can’t stand up… Rhett, stop hurting yourself” 
Brian said and held his hand then he dragged him up. <br>

Juan also assisted him then they took Rhett to his room when they got inside, they laid him on the bed. 
He stared at him and sighed out loud. <br>

“This is the reason why I don’t wanna fall in love” Juan said as he walked out of the room. <br>

Brian asked him where he was going then he told him he is  going out to there to fu**k some bi**h. <br>

“Okay” Brian said and was about to leave the room when he saw a bracelet on the floor. <br>

He picked up, he stared at it and saw Sawyer’s name written on the bed, he put the bracelet on the table then 
he left. <br>

Karin’s Room*** <br>

Karin opened the door and walked in angrily, she sat down on the bed and hissed in anger. Monique and November
 exchanged glances then they sat down with her. <br>

“Hey, what’s wrong?” Monique asked but she ignored them. <br>

She kept on frowning and hissing at the same, November asked if everything was alright but she shook her head
 and told them, she is angry at herself. <br>

“Can you believe that Rhett is in love with the witch” Karin said with a frown. <br>

“With who?” November asked. <br>

“Sawyer” <br>

She said and they frowned and asked her what she did when she found out about it, she shook her head and told
 them she hadn't done anything. <br>

“Karin, we need to teach the girl some lessons… I think she is ready to die” Monique said. <br>

“Don’t worry, we will deal with her.., she should stay away from your boyfriend” November said, gazing at her. <br>

“I will make sure I make her pay” Karin said and lay on the bed. <br>

November and Monique sighed and asked if she wouldn't go to the club with them tonight. <br>

“I am going” Karin said and they smiled. <br>

“We thought you weren't going” November said and she shook her head. <br>

Karin got down on the bed, she undressed her clothes and wrapped a towel around her body then she entered 
the bathroom. <br>

TBC.
