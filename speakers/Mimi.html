        Sawyer’s Room*** <br>

The next morning, Sawyer opened her eyes as she groaned, she heard Piper singing, she got down on the bed 
and went to the bathroom to brush her teeth. When she was done with that, she went to the kitchen. 
She met Piper cooking, she greeted her and asked her about Mimi. <br>

“I think she went to the library” Piper replied. <br>

“It's the weekend so what did she went to do at the library?” She asked and yawned. <br>

“I don’t…” <br>

“Girls!” Mimi called out as she ran into the kitchen. <br>

They faced her and asked the reason why was running. <br>

“Sawyer, someone wants to see you outside” Mimi said, breathing heavily. <br>

Sawyer left the kitchen when she got outside, she met Rhett standing beside a black car, she frowned and 
hissed then she was about to go inside when Rhett held her hand, he dragged her closer to himself, 
they stared at themselves for a while before she pushed him away. <br>

“What’s your problem? Didn’t I tell you to stay away from me” She said and glared at him. <br>

Rhett didn’t say anything, he moved his mouth closer to her ear and whispered into her ear then the next thing 
she did shocked everyone. She slapped him, the students who were passing gasped. <br>

“She is so rude” <br>

“She lay her filthy hand on my crush” <br>

Sawyer glared at him and she muttered under her deep breath “ I don’t want to see your hugly face ever 
and ever again” <br>
By saying that she went inside, Rhett held his cheek and then he used his sunshade, he entered the car. He 
told the driver to drive. <br>

When Sawyer got inside, she sat down on the bed, she stared at the ceiling, she regretted what she did to 
him. <br>

“I think I should go and apologise to him” She thought and stood up when she got outside, she didn’t see 
any traces of him again, she felt so sad then she went inside back. <br>

“Babe, how did it go? Did you guys speak with each other….gist me” Mimi winked. <br>

Sawyer ignored her and dressed up then she left the room. She headed straight to the Library.
 Some minutes later, she got to the library, she didn’t see anyone at the library. She was about
  to walk out of the Library when someone locked the door and switched off the light. <br>

“Who is there? Open the door” She said, trying to open the door. <br>

The person laughed. <br>

“You can’t get away… no one will help you” The person said and left. <br>

“Please whoever you are, open the door… I hate staying in the dark” Sawyer said and tears streamed down her 
face. <br>

She sat down on the floor and burst into more tears. <br>

Karin’s Room*** <br>

Karin and her friends laughed when they got inside, they mimicked Sawyer. November walked towards the fridge
 and take a bottle of water, she gulped it and smiled. <br>

“Next time, she won’t mess with us” Monique said and Karin nodded. <br>

She undressed her clothes and went to the bathroom to take a shower. Some minutes after she was done, she wore
 a crop top with a blue Jean then she packed her hair. When she was done dressing up, she took her bag and
  left the room. <br>

“I can’t wait to see Rhett” She said with a smile. <br>

An hour later, she got to the  Mansion and went inside. Brian was surprised to see her, he smirked and asked
 her the reason why she was her but she ignored his questions and moved closer to him, she touched his lips, 
 she was about to kiss him when Rhett showed up. She moved away from Brian immediately she saw Rhett and 
 pushed him away. <br>

“Hi, babe” She said with a smile. <br>

Rhett frowned and glared at her. <br>

“Didn’t I warn you not to come here again” Rhett said and she rolled. <br>

“Rhett, don’t push me away… I heard what Sawyer did to you at the college today, the girl does not love so why
 are you forcing yourself on her” She said as she sat down. <br>

Rhett was furious so he dragged her out and warned her again not to come again or else he is gonna hurt her. 
She smirked and hugged him tightly. <br>

She muttered under her breath , still hugging him. <br>

“You are mine forever and nobody can never snatch you away from me” <br>

Rhett pushed her away and she scoffed then she walked majestically out. <br>

PM AT RBJ’S MANSION*** <br>

Rhett and Brian were busy playing PlayStation 5 known as Ps5 video game on the television when Juan ran in 
shouting Rhatt’s name. They stopped what they were doing and faced, he gasped for air. <br>

“Why are you running?” Rhett asked, gazing at him. <br>

“Saw…yer… Sawyer, has been taken to the…” <br>

Juan didn’t complete his statement when he ran out, Juan and Brian immediately followed him when they got
 outside, they entered then Rhett drove off speedily. Juan told him the hospital Sawyer was taken to.
  Two hours later, they got to to hospital and went to the receptionist. <br>

“My Girlfriend is here” Rhett said. <br>

“Her name sir” The receptionist. <br>

“Sawyer” Rhett said but the receptionist told him to tell her full name.  <br>

Rhett rubbed his head and glanced at his friends, they shooked their heads then they told him they didn’t 
know her surname. <br>

“I think I remember her surname” Juan said and he glanced at him. <br>

“What’s her name?” The receptionist asked, gazing at him. <br>


“Sawyer Miller” Juan said and the receptionist went through the list on the book then she told them the  ward
 Sawyer’s was taken to, they all ran inside. <br>

When they got inside, they met Piper and Mimi sitting beside her. Rhett moved closer to her and touched her 
face. <br>

“What happened to her?” Rhett asked as he faced her friends. <br>

“She was locked in the library and there was no light there… she doesn’t like to stay in darkness because
 she is always scared, I guessed” Mimi said, staring at Sawyer who was laying on the bed. <br>

“I’m sorry for not staying with you when you need me” Rhett said, brimming in tears. <br>

Brian and Juan exchanged glances. <br>

“Are they in a relationship?” Juan whispered and Brian shook his head. <br>

“Huh… why is he behaving this way?” Juan asked no one in particular. <br>

Rhett touched her hair and kissed it. <br>

An hour later, Sawyer opened her eyes slowly, she glanced around and was surprised to see herself at the 
hospital. <br>

“Babe, you are awake” Mimi said and Rhett stood up from where he was sitting then he moved closer to her. <br>

“I’m so happy that you are awake” Rhett said and she frowned. <br>

“Why is he here?” Sawyer asked. <br>

“He came here when he heard that you were in the hospital” Mimi said and Sawyer told him to get out. <br>

Rhett was sad and at the same time  he was happy because she is feeling better, he stood up and was about to
 leave when Mimi apologised about Sawyer’s behavior, he nodded slowly and left with his friends. When he got 
 outside, he sat down in the receptionist  and was staring at the ward. He sighed  heavily, he was immersed in
  his thoughts deeply. <br>

“Why did she hates me so much?” He thoughts. <br>

Juan coughed and tapped him, he raised his head, his tears were on the verge of falling. Brian sat down
 next to him. <br>

“Rhett, it’s okay… all you need right now is to give her some privacy” Brian said. <br>

“You know I love her so I can’t do that… I don’t know the reason why I love her so much” He said, gazing 
at his friends.b <br>

Brian patted his back and assured him that everything would be very soon.

“Bro, why don’t you forget her” Juan said and he shook his head. <br>

Juan felt pity for him. <br>

AT THE HOSPITAL *** <br>

Mimi and Piper both glanced at themselves and faced Sawyer then Mimi asked her the reason why she sent Rhett 
away, even though she doesn’t like him, she shouldn’t have done that, Sawyer ignored them and closed her eyes,
 she pretended to sleep. <br>

“Sawyer, I know you are listening to us… how could you send Rhett out, he cared about you that was the reason
 he came…” <br>

Her sentence was interrupted. <br>

“He should stop caring about me, I don’t like him” Sawyer said and sat up. <br>

“We all know you don’t like him but you should be nice to him” Piper said. <br>

“I’m not in the mood for all this now… I wanna rest” Sawyer said as she turned her back to them. <br>

Piper stomped out and Mimi moved closer to Sawyer then tapped her. She was about to say something when 
Sawyer’s phone rang. Sawyer glanced at Mimi. <br>

“You can pick the call” Mimi said and she picked up. <br>

Sawyer was on a phone call speaking to her  when Rhett barged in and hugged her. She disconnected the call 
and pushed him away. <br>

“Didn’t I tell you to leave” She  said, angrily. <br>

“I will leave but I promise you I will make sure I find the person that did this to you” Rhett said and left. <br>

Immediately Rhett left, Mimi faced her and told her what she did was no right, she frowned and glared at her.
 She lay on the bed turning her back at her. <br>

“You are so stubborn, Sawyer” Mimi muttered as she walked out of the room. <br>

“I can’t wait to get discharged… I will make sure I find those that locked me at the library. Everyone already
 know my weakness now” Sawyer thought. <br>

She got down on the bed and took the bottle of water on the table, she gulped half of it then climbed onto the
 bed. She exhaled and closed her eyes slowly, she dozed off. <br>

An hour later, she shouted from her dream. <br>

“Kingston, don’t do this to me, I truly love you” She said not opening her eyes. <br>

Tears dropped from her face and someone wiped it away. <br>

TBC. <br>
