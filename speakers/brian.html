        The next day Sawyer and her friends woke up early because they were having lectures today. 
        Mimi kept on frowning her face because she wants to miss class today but 
        Sawyer doesn’t want her to miss today’s class. When Sawyer was done packing her hair with a ribbon, 
        she took some book she’s gonna need, then she left the hostel with her friends. They got to the class,
         a few students were already inside, Sawyer sat down in the front seat and her friends also sat down
          with her. <br>
“What are we having today?” Mimi  asked and groaned. <br>
Piper and Sawyer both glanced at her. <br>
“Mimi, don’t tell me that you didn’t know we were having Data science today?” Sawyer said,
 gazing at her and she shook her head. <br>
Piper smacked her head  and told her she is not serious.
 Some few minutes later, Rhett and his friends entered the class and the girls started screaming,
  the student kept on hyping them until Prof.Gavin entered the class. He glanced at them and asked
   them the reason why they were shouting and screaming but they couldn't say anything. He told them the
     topic they were dealing with today and he explained everything about the lecture.
      Rhett could not concentrate on the lecture because he was glancing  at Sawyer.  An hour later,
      Prof. Gavin was done , then he gave them a project to do and told them they must submit it tomorrow. <br>

“Class Rep, i want to see everyone’s project by 8:00am tomorrow… and if any of them didn’t 
submit their project tomorrow, tell me so that i will know the next thing to do” Prof.Gavin said. <br>
“Okay, sir” Liam said and everyone frowned. <br>
 
Prof. Gavin walked out of the class. Immediately Prof.Gavin left, 
the student started leaving the class one after the other. Mimi sighed
 and started arranging her books. <br>

“Won’t you wait for us?” Piper asked and she nodded. <br>

“Girls, I am so tired”  She said and sighed out loud. <br>

“Mimi, are you really leaving.. We are going to the restaurant won’t you join us” Sawyer said 
and she immediately dropped her stuff back on the table then she sat down. <br>

“Foodie” Piper said and she rolled. <br>

“Girls, i’m starving… let’s go” Sawyer said and her stomach growled. <br>

Sawyer was busy pressing  her phone while walking when she bumped into someone, 
she apologised to the person as she raised her head up. Immediately she saw that it was Rhett, 
she frowned and muttered “Why did i kept on bumping into you” <br>

Rhett couldn’t say anything because he was lost staring at her, she became more 
enraged and tapped him, drifting him out of his thoughts <br>

“I’m sorry” Rhett said and left immediately. <br>

“Weirdo” She  muttered. <br>

Piper turned to her and asked if she offended him and Sawyer shook her head then they left.
 Some minutes later, they got to the restaurant and took their seats. The waiter showed up and 
 gave them the manual, they told her what they wanted then she left. <br>

“Sawyer, what do you do now?” Piper asked, gazing at her. <br>

“Piper, do you think I did anything to him” Sawyer frowned and Mimi told them to stop. <br>

“ i don’t think she did anything to Rhett… can’t you see that Rhett was staring at and 
couldn’t say anything, i think he likes her” Mimi blurted out and Sawyer frowned. <br>

She told her not to say that and why would a guy fall in love with her on the second day of resumption, 
it’s not possible and Mimi shook her  head and told her Love is something that happens to someone 
suddenly so it’s not a big deal. Sawyer got angry and told her to keep quiet that she didn’t
 want to know anything about love. She stood up and left the restaurant then her friend ran after her. <br>

“Sawyer” Piper called and ran after but she didn’t answer, she kept on running. <br>

Piper and Mimi stopped running. <br>

Piper sighed out loud and faced Mimi. <br>

“You shouldn’t have say that”’She said. <br>

Mimi told she didn’t know and they walked away sluggishly. <br>

At the Girls Hostel*** <br>

When Sawyer got to the room, she laid on the bed and burst into tears, 
her mind drifting to the incident that happened to her three years ago. 
Tears kept rolling down her cheeks, she hugged the pillow tightly, she was still sobbing when her phone rang, 
she brought out her phone and checked the caller. She wiped her tears away and picked up. <br>

“Hello, Dad” She said. <br>

When her dad heard her voice, he knew something was wrong with her and asked what happened but
 she told him that she is fine then tears rolled down her cheek. <br>

“Honey, i know you are lying so tell me what happened to you” Mr Miller said and she hung up. <br>

She dropped the phone on the bed and burst into more tears, her phone rang again but
 she didn’t pick up. A minutes later, she wiped her tears away and undressed her clothes, 
 she wrapped a towel on her body then she went to the toilet. When she was done taking a shower, 
 she took the clothes she was going to wear. She was dressing up when Mimi and Piper entered. <br>

“You girls are back” She said with a fake smile. <br>

Mimi and Piper exchanged glances. <br>

“I’m sorry, Sawyer” Mimi apologised and sighed. <br>

“Why are you apologising… it’s nothing” She said and Mimi glanced at her then she nodded slowly. <br>

“Are you sure?” Piper asked, gazing at her. <br>

She nodded as she dressed up. <br>

Piper glanced at Mimi and whispered into her ear. <br>

“I think she is lying” <br>

Mimi nodded and said that was what she was thinking too, Piper told her everything would be 
fine and lay down on the bed. <br>

At The Boys Hostel*** <br>

Rhett was lost in his thoughts, he didn’t listen to what his friend was saying, he was only thinking
 about Sawyer. Juan called him but he didn’t hear so he tapped him and asked why he was so lost, 
 he ignored him and stood up. He took some books and was about to leave when Brian called him and 
 asked him where he was going. He ignored him and left, he was only thinking about Sawyer. 
 When he got to the college, he went straight to the library because he thought 
 Sawyer would be there when he got there, he didn’t see anyone there, he took a deep breath 
 and ran his hand through his hair. <br>

“I shouldn’t be doing this… why would I be falling for a girl on the second of resumption?” He muttered. <br>

He was about to leave when he heard his name, he turned back. He frowned immediately when he saw Karin. <br>

“Didn’t I tell you not to appear in front of me again?” He said and she rolled her eyes. <br>

“Rhett, you know i can’t leave you and the reason why i can’t leave you is because i am in love with you” 
Karin said and moved closer to him. <br>

“Stay away from me” He yelled but she dragged him to herself then she kissed him. <br>

Someone coughed and they turned back, Karin glared at Sawyer and asked her what she wanted. 
Sawyer smirked and told them to move away, she wanted to enter the library. 
Karin ane Rhett moved away and she entered. <br>

“Stay away from me” He said, angrily. <br>

Karin smirked and left, he sighed and entered the library then he sat down next to Sawyer, 
she glanced at him when he sat down with her. She stood up and took another seat, he stood up 
too then he sat down with her. <br>

“What do you want?” Sawyer asked with a frown. <br>

“Nothing” He said and shook his head. <br>

“If you don’t have anything to say, can you please stand up” Sawyer said. <br>

He didn’t hear, he was only staring at her, Sawyer snapped her hand, drifting him out of his thought. <br>

“Stop staring… leave” Sawyer said. <br>

“I wanna say something” He said and she told him, she is listening. <br>

“Sawyer… i thi..nk… I'm… in love.. With..yo..you” He stuttered. <br>

Sawyer burst out laughing <br>

“Why would you fall in love with the person you just met” She asked, gazing at him. <br>

He sighed and told her he didn’t know how it happened. She pushed him away and took her books then 
she left the library. Rhett stood up and left the library. <br>

 When he got to the hostel, he met Juan and Brian eating, he greeted and lay down on the bed. <br>

“Bro. what’s wrong?” Juan asked but he ignored him. <br>

“Rhett, is there something you are hiding from us” Brian asked, gazing at him. <br>

Rhett kept on ignoring them  until his phone rang and he picked up, it was Mr Wesley his manager. <br>

“Hello” He said as he placed the phone on his ear. <br>

Mr Wesley told him the M3 company came to the company today and told them they should collaborate
 together on the next business. Rhett told them not to collaborate and that he doesn't want another 
 company to join them in this business. <br>

“Okay” Mr Wesley said and they spoke more about the business after an hour, they hung up. <br>

His friends glanced at him and sat down with him, they stared at him, Juan touched his 
forehead while Brian touched his and they asked him the reason why he is ignoring them 
where there is nothing happening to him. He rolled and stood up then they also stood up.
 He stopped walking and faced them. <br>

“Tell us what you are hiding from us” Juan said and he frowned. <br>

He took his earpod and listening to some music, Juan and Brian sighed out loud then Juan gave 
Brian an eye signal to removed the earpod from his ear but he shook his head and told him that
 he can’t do that then Juan told him if he can’t do it then he would do it. Juan climbed onto the 
 bed and removed the earpod from his ear. Then he frowned at him and asked him what he wanted. 
 Juan told him he should stop ignoring them and tell them what he is thinking, he shook his head 
 then he told them he is not thinking about anything. Juan glanced at Brian. <br>

“He is so stubborn” Juan whispered and Brian nodded. <br>

They lay down on their beds. <br>
