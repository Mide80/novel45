        Rhett entered the bathroom,  after taking a quick shower, he wore a bathrobe and stepped out 
        of the bathroom, he took the shirt he was going to put on, he used a small towel to rub his hair 
        then he woke Juan and Brian up, they groaned as they opened their eyes. Immediately they saw Rhett 
        still with a bathrobe. They knew that he had taken his bath, Juan immediately ran into the bathroom 
        before Brian entered. Juan greeted  Rhett and yawned, he stood up  then he took the clothes he was
         gonna put on and laid them on the bed. When Rhett was done dressing up, he sat down next to Brian 
         and sighed out loud, Brian asked him what he was thinking about but he couldn’t say anything. <br>

 A minute later, they were discussing the project when Juan stepped out of the bathroom, Brian stood up 
 and went inside the bathroom. <br>

“Rhett, I think we should get a new hostel” Juan said as he put on his shirt. <br>

Rhett nodded and told him that he was thinking the same and he is gonna tell one of his guards to
 get them a Mansion not far from the college, when Juan heard what he said, he smiled and hugged 
 then he only nodded. An hour later they left the hostel and headed straight to the restaurant when 
 they got there they met Sawyer and friends gusting white eating, Rhett took a glimpse at Sawyer and
  then he smiled. He sat down with his friends then they ordered something to eat. Juan and Brian were 
  busy eating while Rhett was holding the spoon and staring at Sawyer, he kept on smiling and staring at her. <br>

“Rhett, won’t you eat” Juan asked and sipped his juice. <br>

“I will eat” He said and Juan nodded. <br>

They were still eating when they heard Sawyer telling her friends that she was leaving, immediately 
Sawyer stood up, he also stood up and followed. He called her name as he ran after her, Sawyer stopped
 walking and turned to him with a smirk. She asked him the reason why he called her but he was speechless.
  Rhett stared at Sawyer, she frowned and snapped her finger drifting him out of his thoughts. She told him 
  if he doesn’t have anything to say then she is leaving. <br>

“I have…” He started and paused. <br>

She glanced at him and hissed then she told him when next he stopped her without say nothing.
 he was gonna see her other side then she left. Rhett rubbed his hair and exhaled, he went back to 
 the restaurant to meet his friend, when he got to the restaurant, he met Juan speaking with Mimi 
 while Brian was pressing his phone. He told them that he was leaving and they nodded. Some hours later, 
 when he got to the classroom, he met only a few students in the class. He glanced around, maybe he was 
 gonna spot Sawyer but he didn’t. He sat down on the chair, frustrated. The only person he is thinking 
 right now is Sawyer, he was lost in his thoughts that he didn’t even notice when his friends entered the
  class, Brian sat down with him while Juan sat down next to Mimi.  Brian glanced at him and tapped him, 
  when he saw Brian he saw down very well. <br>

“You guys are here” He said and Brian nodded. <br>

Immediately Sawyer entered the class, the Professor also entered. The Professor greeted them 
and they responded. The Professor explained the Data science and told them that they would be 
having their first test very soon. Some hours later, he left the class then the students left the class. 
Sawyer and her friends went to the hostel. <br>

Girls Hostel*** <br>

Mimi groaned when they got inside, she fell on the bed while Piper went to the minimum fridge to take 
a bottle of water, she gulped it then she inhaled and exhaled, she sat down on Mimi’s bed. Mimi frowned 
and told her she doesn’t want to share her bed with anyone then she pushed her away. Sawyer chuckled 
and Piper glared at her. She immediately apologized to her and pulled her in a hug then she told them 
she is going to the library to get something. <br>

“What is it?” Piper asked and she bit her lips then she told her that she lost her bracelet. <br>

Piper nodded then she left. She was on her way to when Karin and her friends showed up, they stood up in 
front of Sawyer. Karin glared at her and pushed her away  and Sawyer burst out laughing then she folded her
 hands beneath her br**t.  <br>

“What do you guys want?” She asked, with a frown. <br>

“Sawyer, I only came here to warn you to stay away from my boyfriend or else you’re gonna see my 
other side” Karin said and glared at her. <br>

“Boyfriend?? Who is your boyfriend?” She asked and Karin told her it was Rhett. <br>

She frowned and was about to leave when Karin dragged her back, she became enraged and slapped her.
 Karin held her cheek and raised her hand to slap her back when Rhett showed up, when Karin saw Rhett, 
 he hugged Rhett and told him what Sawyer did to her. <br>

“Karin stop lying, I saw everything” Rhett said and pushed her away. <br>

Sawyer scoffed and glared at them then she left, Rhett told Karin to stay away from Sawyer 
then he ran after her. He called Sawyer running after but she didn’t answer, he stopped running 
and walked sluggishly to the library when he got there, he met Sawyer and Reese sitting together. 
He walked towards them, immediately Sawyer him, she stood up and was about to leave when he held her hand, 
she yanked her. <br>

“Reese, I am leaving… see you later” Sawyer said, packing her stuff. <br>

“Why?” Reese asked, gazing at her. <br>

She glanced at Rhett then at Reese. <br>

“Nothing” She said as she walked away. <br>

Reese nodded and she left then Rhett sat down with Reese, she asked him why Sawyer
 left after seeing him, he narrated everything to her then she told him to sort things with her, 
 he nodded. <br>

Boys Hostel**** <br>

When Juan was done putting on his shirt, he left the room. Some minutes later, he got to the girl’s 
hostel and headed straight to Mimi’s room. He knocked on the door but did not respond, he was about to 
knock again when someone opened. He raised his head up and the person turned out to be Piper. He smiled
 and asked if he could come in. Piper stared at him for a while then she nodded, he entered the room. 
 When he got inside he met Mimi laying on the bed. <br>

“Hey” He said with a smile. <br>

“Juan, why did you come here?” Mimi asked and sat up. <br>

“Babe, I miss you” Juan said and Piper glanced at them. <br>

Mimi told him they should go out and he nodded then they left. They went to the school garden when 
they got there, they sat down on the bench, holding each other’s hand, they kept staring at themselves. <br>

“Wow… he is cute” Mimi thought. <br>

Juan told her that he wanna tell her something and she nodded slowly. He stared at her for a while before
 speaking. <br>

“Mimi… I… think… I am in..lo…love with you” He stuttered. <br>

Mimi was shocked when she heard what he said, she was speechless, she immediately stood up when she heard
 what he said. She exhaled and told him she does not have any feelings for him, she bit her lips then 
 she turned back. Juan stood up and wrapped his hand around her waist, he touched her then he told her 
 that she was lying. <br>

“He is a playboy, Mimi… don’t fall for his trick” Her subconsciousness said. <br>

“Mimi” Juan called and tapped her, drifting her out of her thoughts. <br>

She pushed him away and ran out of the garden, Juan smiled and rubbed his hand on his hair then left
 the garden. He was on his way to the hostel when Rhett and Brian showed up. He glanced at them and asked
  them the reason why they were there. Then Rhett told him they should go and check the Mansion they would
   be moving to. <br>

“My driver will soon be here” Rhett said. <br>

A few moments later, a car parked in front of them and they entered the car then the driver drove off. 
The driving to the Mansion was so silent, none of them said anything till they reached the Mansion. Juan
 gasped and entered the Mansion with his friend when they got inside, they met everywhere so neat. <br>

“I will take the first room,”Juan said and ran upstairs. <br>

Brian shook his head while Rhett rolled and sat down on the couch. Brian walked towards the fridge, he took 
a bottle of water and gulped it, he inhaled and exhaled then he sat down next to Rhett. He called Rhett 
but he was immersed in thoughts deeply then he tapped him and asked him what he was thinking about. Rhett
 sighed heavily and stood up then he went upstairs. <br>

“I don’t know what he is hiding… we are brothers, why can’t he tell us what is bothering him” Brian thought
 and went upstairs. <br>

When Rhett got to his room, he laid down on the bed his eyes staring at the ceiling blankly, 
his sighed out loud then he muttered “I missed her so much” <br>

TBC.
